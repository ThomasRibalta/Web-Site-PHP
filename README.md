# Web-Site-PHP
This is my first full php website without framework like symfony or laravel. I made this project following the Grafikart tutorials. For me that's was an opportunity to learn and test my actual skill's in php. 

# Theme of website
For this first website in php, i decid to follow the tutorial theme and make an blog website. On this blog you can search by post or by category.
